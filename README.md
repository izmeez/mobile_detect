Mobile Detect
=============

This is a lightweight mobile detection module based on the
[Mobile Detect library](https://github.com/serbanghita/Mobile-Detect),
version 2.8.47 which is bundled in this module.

This module is intended to aid developers utilizing mobile-first and
responsive design techniques who also have a need for slight changes for
mobile and tablet users. An example would be showing (or hiding) a block
or content pane to a particular device.

This module is not intended (and never will be enhanced) to provide
theme switching or redirection; other modules already provide this
functionality.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the [official Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules).

If you think everything is installed correctly but it isn't working, you may
need to clear  the Backdrop caches (**admin/config/development/performance**).

Usage
------------

The base module just provides a factory method for creating a singleton
of the mobile detection class, for use in themes and other modules:

    $detect = mobile_detect_get_object();
    $is_tablet = $detect->isTablet();
    $is_mobile = $detect->isMobile();

See the documentation for the Mobile_Detect library for more information.

Backdrop Page Cache Support
-------------------------

Experimental support is provided for working with the Backdrop page cache.

To use this, enable the mobile_detect_caching module.  And then add
to settings.php file:

    $conf['cache_backends'][] = 'modules/mobile_detect/mobile_detect_caching/mobile_detect_caching.inc';
    $conf['cache_class_cache_page'] = 'MobileDetectCache';
    $conf['mobile_detect_library'] = 'modules/mobile_detect/libraries/Mobile_Detect.php';

You may need to adjust the path if you installed
the module in a different location.

Developers
------------

If your module requires the library provided by this wrapper, you can access the
library by:

- Requiring this module as a dependency in your module
- Loading the file as follows: `include_once (backdrop_get_path('module', 'mobile_detect') . '/libraries/Mobile_Detect.php');`
